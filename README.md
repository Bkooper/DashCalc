Goal:
The primary objective of DeliverWorth is to provide Uber Eats drivers with a quick and easy way to determine if a delivery is financially worthwhile. By simply entering their car's mileage and the current gas price in their area, drivers can upload a screenshot of their delivery details, and DeliverWorth will use OCR technology to analyze the image and calculate the profitability of the delivery.

How to Use:

-Upload Screenshot:
  Upload a screenshot of your Uber Eats delivery details by clicking the "Choose File" button and selecting the image.
  Click the "Process Screenshot" button to analyze the image. The application will use OCR to read the text on the screenshot and extract the necessary data.

-View Results
  The extracted data will be displayed in the respective fields.
  Click the "Calculate" button to see the total cost of the delivery trip, profit, profit per mile, and dollar per hour.
